# Some UI elements from: https://www.graphicsfuel.com/2013/02/dark-music-ui-elements-psd/
# Dark Music UI Design Kit (PSD) at graphicsfuel.com (states free for commercial and personal use)
# But as I don't have photoshop had to just reconstruct everything from the single screenshot, as can't use PSD files.
# I think I did an ok job at reconstructing different button states and animated sliders, from static screenshot
# But could probably be done better with access to the original UI elements.
